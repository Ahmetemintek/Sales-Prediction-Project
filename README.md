# Future Sales Forecasting

## Introduction
This repository contains the graduation project from a Data Science Bootcamp, focusing on future sales forecasting using time-series analysis. The main dataset used in this project is provided by 1C Company, one of the largest Russian software firms. The goal is to predict the total number of products sold in each shop for the test set period.

## Dataset Description
The project utilizes five main datasets:
1. **Training Data:** Contains historical daily sales data.
2. **Test Data:** Represents the test set for sales forecasting.
3. **Items Data:** Provides information about the items being sold.
4. **Item Categories Data:** Describes the categories of items.
5. **Shops Names Data:** Includes details about the shops where sales occur.

For more detailed information about these datasets, refer to the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).

## Files in Repository
- **Future_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code and analysis for the sales forecasting project.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning and transforming the datasets.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering and selection.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing sales trends over time.
   - Analyzing correlations between variables.
   - Understanding item and shop characteristics.

3. Model Building:
   - Implementing various machine learning/deep learning models for forecasting(XGBoost, RNN, LSTM).
   - Tuning hyperparameters and evaluating model performance.

4. Prediction and Evaluation:
   - Generating forecasts for future sales.
   - Assessing model performance and making improvements if needed.
