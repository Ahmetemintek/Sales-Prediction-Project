# Future Sales Forecasting
### There is one .ipynb file in this repository which consits the graduation project from Data Science Bootcamp. 
In this project we will work with a time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. The aim is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. We have 5 different datasets:
- Training Data
- Test Data
- Items Data
- Item Categories Data
- Shops Names Data

For more information about datasets, you can visit this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).
